The HDX Python API Library is designed to enable you to easily develop code that
interacts with the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX)
platform. The major goal of the library is to make pushing and pulling data from HDX as
simple as possible for the end user.

For more information, please read the
[documentation](https://hdx-python-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)
(HDX) project. If you have humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to
HDX.

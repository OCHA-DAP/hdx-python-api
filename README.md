The HDX Python API Library is designed to enable you to easily develop code that interacts with the [Humanitarian Data
Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) platform. The major goal of the library is to make pushing and pulling data 
from HDX as simple as possible for the end user.

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://hdx-python-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) project. If you have 
humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to HDX.
